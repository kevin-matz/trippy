# ChatGPT prompt: I have a react frontend but dont know how to dockerize it. Can you help me write the Dockerfile for it? Im using Vite and after running npm run build the prod files are in /dist.

# Use a lighter version of Node as a parent image
FROM node:lts-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json (if available)
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the app's source code
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production using Vite
RUN npm run build

# Set up a lightweight web server to serve the production build
RUN npm install -g serve

# Expose the port
EXPOSE 20011

# Set the command to serve the production build
CMD ["serve", "-s", "dist", "-p", "20011"]
